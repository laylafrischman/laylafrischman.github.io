# About Me

I grew up with dinner table discussions about technology and mathematics, and later gained a passion for computer programming in my first year of university; This is the short story of what lead me to becoming an Industrial Engineering student at the University of Toronto. In my future studies, I plan to specialize in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
