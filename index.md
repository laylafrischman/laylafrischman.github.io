## **About Me**

I grew up with dinner table discussions about technology and mathematics, and later gained a passion for computer programming in my first year of university; This is the short story of what lead me to becoming an Industrial Engineering student at the University of Toronto.

## **Work Experience**

**Advanced Mirco Devides (AMD)**<br>
*Machine Learning Software Engineering Program Management*

During my 16-month internship at AMD, I collaborated with teams to deploy ROCm, an open-source software solution for GPU hardware, to clients including Microsoft, Atos, and U.S National Laboratories. My responsibilities included managing a key European high-performance computing client through communicating vital information to stakeholders, unblocking releases, and coordinating knowledge-sharing sessions. Additionally, I implemented an asset management system to optimize resource utilization, track inactive periods and facilitate reservations. Managing software infrastructure was also a part of my role, entailing allocation of limited resources across teams and collaborating with the lab team to resolve defects.

## **Projects**

 **Machine Learning**<br>
*Image Upscaling*

Three classmates and I created a machine learning model using PyTorch which takes in a low resolution image with dimensions 56x56 pixels, and outputs a high resolution version of the input with dimensions 224x224 using a Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN). We used a Super Resolution General Adversarial Network (SRGAN) as a baseline model. Results showed that our primary model outperformed the baseline quantitatively, however, the quality of the images did not appear significantly better.

**AI and Optimization**<br>
*Predicting and Optimizing Charitable Donations*

Three classmates and I created a Lasso linear regression model using Python which predicts how charitable people are per zip code based on data from IRS tax returns. We then used those results to find the optimal route for fundraisers to travel which will maximize their expected collected donations. Our ultimate goal is for this model to be used by nonprofits to strategically plan where to fundraise. 

**Algorithms**<br>
*Routing and Wavelength Assignments in Telecommunications Networks*

Three classmates and I applied Python to implement various algorithms to optimize light path assignments for connection requests. Through comparison and analysis of outcomes, we provided recommendations for the most suitable algorithm based on a balance of solution quality and time efficiency.

*Stable Matching Students and Schools*

I developed a program in Java that finds stable matches between students and schools based on students’ criteria and schools’ weight of criteria using Gale–Shapley algorithm.
  
**Community Involvement**<br>
*Jewish Engineering Society*

A classmate and I created a club called the [Jewish Engineering Society](https://jes.skule.ca/) to address the needs of and enhance the experience of Jewish engineering students, or any engineering students interested in Jewish culture. Our aim is to create a strong campus community where students make meaningful connections built on both a cultural and professional foundation.

*Podcast Researcher and Developer*

  As part of the University of Toronto Work Study program, I worked within the [Engineering Communication Program](https://ecp.engineering.utoronto.ca/) to aid in the creation of a podcast series to be used as an educational tool. I had the opportunity to research the topic of engineering intuition, as well as to conduct and shadow numerous podcast interviews.
