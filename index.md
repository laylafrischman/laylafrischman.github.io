## **About Me**

I grew up with dinner table discussions about technology and mathematics, and later gained a passion for computer programming in my first year of university; This is the short story of what lead me to becoming an Industrial Engineering student at the University of Toronto. In my future studies, I plan to specialize in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Some of my responsibilities included managing the company website and YouTube page, and digitizing archived files.
  
- **Podcast Researcher and Developer**

  As part of the University of Toronto Work Study program, I worked within the Engineering Communication Program to aid in the creation of a podcast series to be used as an educational tool. I had the opportunity to research the topic of engineering intuition, as well as to conduct and shadow numerous podcast interviews.
  
- **Co-Founder of the Jewish Engineering Society**

  A classmate and I created a club to address the needs of and enhance the experience of Jewish engineering students, or any engineering students interested in Jewish culture. Our aim is to create a strong campus community where students make meaningful connections built on both a cultural and professional foundation. Check out our website, https://jes.skule.ca.
