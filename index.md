## **About Me**

I grew up with dinner table discussions about technology and mathematics, and later gained a passion for computer programming in my first year of university; This is the short story of what lead me to becoming an Industrial Engineering student at the University of Toronto.

## **Projects**

 **Machine Learning**<br>
*Image Upscaling*

Three classmates and I created a machine learning model which takes in a low resolution image with dimensions 56x56 pixels, and outputs a high resolution version of the input with dimensions 224x224 using a Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN). We used a Super Resolution General Adversarial Network (SRGAN) as a baseline model. Results showed that our primary model outperformed the baseline quantitatively, however, the quality of the images did not appear significantly better.

**AI and Optimization**<br>
*Predicting and Optimizing Charitable Donations*

Three classmates and I created a Lasso linear regression model using Python which predicts how charitable people are per zip code based on data from IRS tax returns. We then used those results to find the optimal route for fundraisers to travel which will maximize their expected collected donations. Our ultimate goal is for this model to be used by nonprofits to strategically plan where to fundraise. 

**Web Development**<br>
*LettuceMeat (Let-us-meet)*

Currently, UofT students are only able to see the events of clubs they directly follow on social media and may miss out on events that they are unaware of. To solve this problem, a group of Industrial Engineering students and I created a web application called LettuceMeat, which contains a central schedule for all club events occurring at UofT. We used a combination of Java and SQL to build the site, and a relational database to store data and dynamically present unique information to each user.
  
**Community Involvement**<br>
*Jewish Engineering Society*

A classmate and I created a club called the [Jewish Engineering Society](https://jes.skule.ca/) to address the needs of and enhance the experience of Jewish engineering students, or any engineering students interested in Jewish culture. Our aim is to create a strong campus community where students make meaningful connections built on both a cultural and professional foundation.

*Podcast Researcher and Developer*

  As part of the University of Toronto Work Study program, I worked within the [Engineering Communication Program](https://ecp.engineering.utoronto.ca/) to aid in the creation of a podcast series to be used as an educational tool. I had the opportunity to research the topic of engineering intuition, as well as to conduct and shadow numerous podcast interviews.
